### Intro

Today is the second day of my visit to the Microsoft Campus in Redmond for the WCCP (Windows Customer Connection Program) Summit 2022

We had a visit of [Steve Dispensa](<https://twitter.com/dispensa>) that started the day with a talk.

After that we did have roundtable sessions together with Microsofties and they where very active and fun to do.

### Windows Insider MVP

Today I did meet [Brandon Patoc](https://twitter.com/brandonpatoc) of the WIP team at building 40.
