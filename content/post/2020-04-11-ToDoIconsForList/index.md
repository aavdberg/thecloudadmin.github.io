I was seeing a blog post of Thomas Maurer about how you could do planning with Azure DevOps and Microsoft ToDo.

{{< tweet user="ThomasMaurer" id="1248668559485685763" >}}

And then I did see that he had icons in front of the lists he made. So I google some and found in a UserVoice from ToDo out how you can do this.

{{< figure src="images/ToDo-000.jpg" title="Lists with emojis" lightbox="true" >}}

### How to add icons to your list

Create a new list

{{< figure src="images/ToDo-001.jpg" title="Create new Lists" lightbox="true" >}}

Then by pressing the {{< icon name="windows" pack="fab" >}}+. or {{< icon name="windows" pack="fab" >}}+; you get the emoji chooser.

{{< figure src="images/ToDo-002.jpg" title="Add emoji to Lists" lightbox="true" >}}

Now you can choose you emoji and exit the emoji chooser by clicking on the X of by pressing on the ESC key.

{{< figure src="images/ToDo-003.jpg" title="Add emoji to Lists" lightbox="true" >}}

Type now your text and hit enter and your done. You will see that the emoji did get the icon of your ToDo list.

{{< figure src="images/ToDo-004.jpg" title="Add emoji to Lists" lightbox="true" >}}

I wish you many creativity with the emoji as icons on your ToDo lists.
