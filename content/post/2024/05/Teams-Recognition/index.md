## **Voice and Face Enrollment in Microsoft Teams**

Microsoft Teams continues to evolve, offering new features and enhancements to improve collaboration and productivity. One such feature that has gained attention is **voice and face enrollment**. In this blog post, we'll explore what it is, how it works, and its benefits.

## **What is Voice and Face Enrollment?**

Voice and face enrollment is a feature within Microsoft Teams that allows users to create personalized voice and face profiles. These profiles enhance the audio quality during Teams meetings and calls, reduce background noise, and improve the overall user experience.

## **Overview:**

- **Enrollment Process:**
  - Users can enroll their voice and face profiles through the Teams Desktop app.
  - First, they enroll their voice, and then they can proceed to enroll their face.
  - Removing the voice profile automatically removes the associated face profile, but removing the face profile leaves the voice profile intact.
  - Users can delete their voice and face profiles at any time, even if the enrollment policy is turned off.
- **Supported Languages:**
  - The language of the Teams app installed determines the voice enrollment languages available to users.
- **Purpose:**
  - Microsoft uses voice and face profiles solely for providing the voice and face enrollment feature in Teams. These profiles are not used for training models or any other purposes.
- **IntelliFrame and Intelligent Camera:**
  - Teams Rooms equipped with Microsoft Multi-Stream IntelliFrame certified devices can recognize users' faces and voices. These devices include AI cameras that track facial movements and gestures, enhancing the meeting experience.
- **Automatic Recognition:**
  - Once users create a Recognition profile, supported cameras can automatically recognize them in any meeting without further action.

## **How Does It Work?**

1. **Enrollment Process:**
   - Users can enroll their voice and face profiles through the Teams Desktop app.
   - First, they enroll their voice by recording a sample phrase. Then, they proceed to enroll their face by capturing images.
   - Removing the voice profile automatically removes the associated face profile, but removing the face profile leaves the voice profile intact.

2. **Supported Languages:**
   - The language of the Teams app installed determines the voice enrollment languages available to users.

3. **Purpose and Privacy:**
   - Microsoft uses voice and face profiles solely for providing the voice and face enrollment feature in Teams. These profiles are not used for training models or any other purposes.
   - Admins can manage and configure voice and face enrollment settings for specific users or groups.

4. **IntelliFrame and Intelligent Camera:**
   - Teams Rooms equipped with Microsoft Multi-Stream IntelliFrame certified devices can recognize users' faces and voices. These devices include AI cameras that track facial movements and gestures, enhancing the meeting experience.

5. **Automatic Recognition:**
   - Once users create a Recognition profile, supported cameras can automatically recognize them in any meeting without further action.

## **Benefits of Voice and Face Enrollment:**

- **Improved Audio Quality:** Voice profiles help reduce background noise and enhance audio clarity.
- **Speaker Identification:** Teams can identify speakers during meetings, making it easier to follow conversations.
- **Privacy Controls:** Users have control over their profiles and can delete them at any time.
- **Enhanced Meeting Experience:** IntelliFrame-equipped cameras improve video quality and tracking.
