On 30 june I ordered a Surface Travel Hub to use with my Surface Book 3 and Surface Go. On the second of July i get it delivered home and unpacked it.

I was pleasant surprise by the size, expected that it was bigger. The box is nearly the same size as the Surface Pen box.

There is a USB-C and a USB-A on one side.

And HDMI and Network on the other side.

Then there is also a old fashioned VGA connector. The place where you can store the USB-C connector is done really nice and also feels solid.
