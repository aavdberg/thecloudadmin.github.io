FullStaq asked me if I want to write a text for there \#StickerTuesday that they post every week on Tuesday on social media like Twitter and Linkedin, and of course I did say yes to them. I very much like stickers, what you can also see in the text that I wrote.

I also take my @MyStickerBox to all the Events and Meetups that I visit.
