### Intro

With Microsoft 365 Home for example you can switch between channels (Office Insider), by going to File -> Accounts and there you have on the right the following button:

{{< figure src="images/Office-Insiders-change-channel-001.png" title="" lightbox="true" >}}

When you click on it you get the following options

{{< figure src="images/Office-Insiders-change-channel-002.png" title="" lightbox="true" >}}

By clicking on "Change Channel" you get a screen where you can join and change from channel

{{< figure src="images/Office-Insiders-change-channel-003.png" title="" lightbox="true" >}}


But wait you would say, with the Microsoft 365 Apps for Business or Enterprise I don't have the

{{< figure src="images/Office-Insiders-change-channel-001.png" title="" lightbox="true" >}}

Button at all. Your right, by default this button is not there for Microsoft 365 Apps for Business or Enterprise.

So what i did in the past de-install my Office Insider and configure and install it with the [Custom Install](https://insider.office.com/en-us/business/deploy/windows/office-deployment-tool)

### Getting the Change Channel Button for Office Insider

By configuring a GPO or adding a Registry Key you can make appear the following button

{{< figure src="images/Office-Insiders-change-channel-001.png" title="" lightbox="true" >}}

Configuring it with a GPO looks like the following:

{{< figure src="images/Office-Insiders-change-channel-004.png" title="" lightbox="true" >}}


> When enabling this policy, make sure the Update Channel and Update Path policies arenâ€™t enabled or the Office Insider button will show but the selected Insider settings will not apply.

Configuring it with a registry key looks like this:

{{< figure src="images/Office-Insiders-change-channel-005.png" title="" lightbox="true" >}}

You could use the following PowerShell command to create it:

{{< figure src="images/Office-Insiders-change-channel-006.png" title="" lightbox="true" >}}

```powershell
New-Item -Path HKCU:\SOFTWARE\Policies\Microsoft\Office\16.0\common\ -force | New-ItemProperty -Name insiderslabbehavior -PropertyType DWORD -Value 1 -Force
```
After you close and open an Microsoft 365 App you will see the Office Insiders button.

### Switching between channel builds

You can also use the following registry 

```powershell
New-Item -Path HKCU:\SOFTWARE\Policies\Microsoft\Office\16.0\common\officeupdate -force | New-ItemProperty -Name updatebranch -PropertyType REG_SZ -Value "InsiderFast" -Force
```
There following name you can place on the above line as value, to get the different Office channels.

* InsiderFast
* FirstReleaseCurrent 
* Current
* MonthlyEnterprise 
* FirstReleaseDeferred 
* Deferred

When you did the change you have to choose File --> Account and the Update Option

{{< figure src="images/Office-Insiders-change-channel-007.png" title="" lightbox="true" >}}

and then Update Now

{{< figure src="images/Office-Insiders-change-channel-008.png" title="" lightbox="true" >}}

And the you will have a other office channel build without re-installing.

### Conclusion

This trick saved me many time and now can also switch fast between channel versions when I have to test something. The blog from [MSOutlook.info](https://www.msoutlook.info/question/office-365-for-business-office-insider-fast-builds) helped my to get this done.
