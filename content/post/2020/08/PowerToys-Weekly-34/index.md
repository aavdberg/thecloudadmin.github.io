## Intro

This is the eight week of PowerToys for Windows 10 on my blog, this week I will look at the tool Color Picker that is part of the PowerToys version 0.20 that is released in july.

At this moment version 0.20.1 is released with bugfixes. You can also go to the [Releases on GitHub](https://github.com/microsoft/PowerToys/releases/) and find here always the latest version.

## Color Picker what can you do with it

The name already gives it away, but you can select a color that is on your screen and it will be put as color code in you clipboard.

## Conclusion

So after some time we have again a new tool in the PowerToys family, and it's very handy for example you work with theme configuration files and have to fill in there color codes. But also with programming it can help you choosing colors that you like to use in your programs.
