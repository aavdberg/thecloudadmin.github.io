## Intro

For about one month I am using the microsoft Surface precision mouse, before I did use the Microsoft Surface Mouse. But one disadvantage with this mouse is that it can only be connected to one device at a time.

With the Microsoft Surface precision mouse you can have tree profile where you can switch between, this is handy because I use for my daily work a Surface Book 3 and I use my private owned Surface Book 3 for my community work and flighting Windows Insiders builds.

## Profile for different devices

You can have 3 profiles (connections to devices) where you can switch between.

## Connection

You can connect the mouse with Bluetooth to 3 differente devices or with a USB cable to one device at a time.

## Buttons

You have 3 buttons that you can customize with your own actions. You have to download the Mouse and Keyboard Center Software to configure the buttons.

## Rechargeable battery

You van recharge the mouse with a USB-C cable and at the same time when it is charging you can still use it.

## Conclusion

All with all I am very happy with my new Microsoft Surface precision mouse.
