## PowerToys Text Extraction

I use this daily when i have to extract some text from a image for example to past it in a translation site a Administrator for example installed a server with the France or other language instead of english and then install a language pack over it. Or when i am lazy and don't want to type over the text from a image.

### Good to now about languages other then default on your system

When you want to use the PowerToys Text Extractor tool to extract a other language then your default system language you have to install the OCR language packs.

With the following PowerShell command you can see what OCR language packs are installed. This Powershell command needs to be run with elevated rights.

```powershell
Get-WindowsCapability -Online | Where-Object { ($_.Name -Like 'Language.OCR*') -and ($_.State -Like 'Installed') }
```

and with the PowerShell next command you can see which OCR language packs are available

```powershell
Get-WindowsCapability -Online | Where-Object { ($_.Name -Like 'Language.OCR*') -and ($_.State -Like 'NotPresent') } | Out-GridView
```

and the following PowerShell you can use to install very easy an missing OCR language packs that you selecting

```powershell
$ocrLanguagePacks = Get-WindowsCapability -Online | Where-Object { ($_.Name -Like 'Language.OCR*') -and ($_.State -Like 'NotPresent') } | Out-GridView -OutputMode Multiple -Title 'Select the OCR language packs you want to install'
foreach ($ocrLanguagePack in $ocrLanguagePacks) {
    <# $currentItemName is the current item #>
    $Capability = Get-WindowsCapability -Online | Where-Object { $_.Name -Like $ocrLanguagePack.Name }
    $Capability | Add-WindowsCapability -Online
}
```
