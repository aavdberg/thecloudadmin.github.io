## Review about Microsoft Surface Headset

I have bought a Microsoft Headset as I like very much the Surface hardware like the Surface Book that I use for my work and the Surface Pro 3 that I use private and the Surface Go since shortly also.

On my work, I have many phone conversations with Skype for Business and on my private tenant, I use Microsoft Teams. And the nice thing about the Microsoft Surface headset is that it's Skype and Teams certified.

Also, you can pair it with more than one device at the same time.

The battery is also lasting long something like 12 hours.

It's sitting comfortably and is not too heavy.

There is also an app for where you can update the firmware, reset de headset, see the level of noise-canceling and the volume of the headset.

To install the app when you not in the area where Cortana is available, you can change your region and location temporarily and install it from the store and after installed change your regio and location back.
