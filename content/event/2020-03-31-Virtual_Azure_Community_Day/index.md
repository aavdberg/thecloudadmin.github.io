Where do all the sessions go when events and meetups are being cancelled all over the world? We thought it would be fun to create a platform where we, as a community, can virtually get together and enjoy those sessions you don't want to miss out on.

Join us for the first ever Virtual Azure Community Day! No stickers or socks, but 8 hours of technical geekery. There's multiple streams hosted from Belgium, France, The Netherlands and Central and Eastern European countries.
