summary: The goal of the Workplace Ninja Virtual Edition is to share knowledge and learn together. This covers topics around management of endpoints with SCCM and Intune, as well virtual desktop and the complete security stack of Microsoft. Since the event is virtual, we can’t see each other personally but we will provide a NinjaZone, where we can connect with each other.
