21h05 – 21h50: Hitchhiker’s guide with 10 practical examples to use CMPivot for the ITPRO to help audit and control: by Kenny Buntinx (Microsoft MVP ECM)

Configuration Manager has always provided a large centralized store of device data, which customers use for reporting and query purposes. The site typically collects this data on a weekly basis. Starting in version 1806, CMPivot is a new in-console utility that now provides access to real-time state of devices in your environment. It immediately runs a query on all currently connected devices in the target collection and returns the results. By providing real-time data from online clients, you can more quickly answer business questions, troubleshoot issues, and respond to security incidents. We will show you our 10 most used CMPivot Queries and how this will simplify your life as an SCCM administrator.
What you will learn:
