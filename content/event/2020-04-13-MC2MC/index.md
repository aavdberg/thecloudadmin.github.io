Agenda:
20h00 – 20u10: Welcome

20h10 – 20u55: Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) in Intune and beyond by Mirko Colemberg (Microsoft MVP EMS)
Another Security level in Azure, how it works and how we can implement RBAC. Do we need a Use Case for it? Yes it helps, but how? Those are some questions around RBAC, in this Session we will see the light on the end of the tunnel and how easy it is to implement. Role-based access control (RBAC) helps you manage who has access to your organization’s resources and what they can do with those resources. By assigning roles to your Intune users, you can limit what they can see and change. Each role has a set of permissions that determine what users with that role can access and change within your organization. This feature offers much greater flexibility and control to ensure your IT administrators have the right permissions to perform their job, and no more. I want to walk you through some of the features of RBAC, plus help you understand how Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) Directory Roles are supported by Intune and beyond.

20h55 – 21h05: Break

21h05 – 21h50: Deploying a static website on Azure for $5 a month by Peter De Tender
Long gone is the time of spending big buckets of money on websites; several use cases exist (blog site, community web site, your moonlighting information webpage,…)  what made WordPress so popular. But these also come with a cost. Wouldn’t it be cool to still offer the same functionality, but all this for less than $5 a month? Learn in this session from Peter, an Azure Business Program Manager within Microsoft, passionate Azure trainer and former Azure MVP, how to build a Hugo website, publish it into Azure Storage Accounts, and optimize it with Azure Front Door.

21h50 – 22h00: Q&A
